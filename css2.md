6. Flexbox
   - flex container
   - flex items

Flexbox is a set of related CSS properties for building 1-dimensional layouts

ðŸ‘‰ The main idea behind flexbox is that empty space inside a container element
can be automatically divided by its child elements

ðŸ‘‰ Flexbox makes it easy to automatically align items to one another inside a parent container, both horizontally and vertically

ðŸ‘‰ Flexbox solves common problems such as vertical centering and creating equal-height columns

ðŸ‘‰ Flexbox is perfect for replacing floats,allowing us to write fewer and cleaner HTML and CSS code

7. Flexbox terminology

   - Flex container = display:flex
     - gap: to create space between the item without using margin.
     - justify-content: to aligh items along main axis/horizontal
     - align-items: to aligh items along cross axis/vertically
     - flex-direction : to change the items direction on the main axix/horizonatal
     - flex-wrap: to allow items to wrap into a new line
   - Flex items

     - Main axis
     - Cross Axis
     - aligh-self

     - flex-grow:0
       - specifies how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container.
     - flex-shrink:1
       - shrink or not inside the container. 1 true and 0 false
     - flex-basis:auto
       - specifies the initial length of a flexible item.
     - flex: shorthand (g s b)

     - order: by default its 0, -ve number will arrange the element to the left and the +ve number will take the element to the right.

   - the end
