Hardware: the visible parts of the system. 
The Beginning of Computation Devices : 
Roman abacus - 2400 BC (Abacus arithmetic devices used for 1000 years or for millennia)
The Antikythera mechanism - 100BCE - astronomical computer
Slide rule - early 1620 
It's a hand-operated analogue computer for doing multiplications and divisions.
Now slide rules are replaced with calculators and computers

The most relevant predecessor to today's computers is the Jacquard loom invented in France by Joseph Marie Jacquard around 1800.

Jacquard loom machines work with punch cards, which means rectangular cards with multiple rows of holes that specify weaving patterns.
